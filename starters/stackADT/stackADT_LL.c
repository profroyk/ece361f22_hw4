 * This is the stack ADT that you are implementing for the assignment.
 * Your stack ADT should implement the API which is defined in "stackADT_LL.h"
 * and should use the API defined and implemented in Roy's Linked List ADT (included
 * in starters/SLLLinked List.
 *
 * @note (Hint) The Linked List ADT should do most of the "heavy lifting"
 *  This ADT should make use of the SLLLinkedList API as the "stack"
